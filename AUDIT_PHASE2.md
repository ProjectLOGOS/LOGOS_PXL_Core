# LOGOS Alignment Core  Phase 1 complete / Phase 2 kickoff

- Proof-before-act paths: 8/8 hardened
- Kernel hash pinning: active (e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855)
- Attested I/O demo:  added and verified
- Metrics: proof duration logging active (metrics/proofs.csv)
- Planner gating: BOX per-step, DIAMOND reachability, countermodel prune
- OBDC preservation: enforced via f obligations
- Health: Prover /health OK, sandbox proofs OK
- Enhanced components: privative policies, reference monitor, OBDC kernel, archon planner

## Phase 1 Achievements
- Reference monitor with strict provenance validation
- Kernel hash verification preventing bypass
- Per-step planning authorization with DIAMOND/BOX modalities
- OBDC structure-preserving operations with f obligations
- Comprehensive audit trail and metrics collection

## Phase 2 Components Added
- Attested I/O module with cryptographic verification
- Metrics collection system for proof operation timing
- CI kernel hash pinning script for reproducible builds
- Enhanced policy hooks for Good/TrueP/Coherent predicates

Next: replace stub prover with Coq+SerAPI, expand domain lemmas, add Postgres audit + Prometheus metrics.
