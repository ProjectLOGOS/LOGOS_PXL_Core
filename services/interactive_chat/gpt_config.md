# LOGOS GPT Integration Configuration
# ====================================

# To enable GPT integration, set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
# 
# Windows PowerShell:
#   $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
#
# Linux/Mac:
#   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
#
# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# Free tier available with $5 credit for new accounts

# Example usage (after setting API key):
# 1. User: "Hello, can you analyze this text: Machine learning is transforming industries"
# 2. GPT detects intent and routes to TETRAGNOS
# 3. Result: Intelligent semantic analysis with conversational explanation

# Without API key:
# System falls back to enhanced pattern matching (better than before)

# Cost estimate: ~$0.01 per conversation, ~$10/month for 1000 conversations
