  (* TeleologicalTraceability: For any Plan P there exists Goal g such
     that Targets P g, and that Goal g can be ranked/valued by
     Axiopraxis (Goodness / Beauty / Justice metrics). This enables
     arbitration across competing candidate plans. *)
  Parameter RankGoal : Goal -> R.

  Theorem TeleologicalTraceability : forall (P:Plan),
    (exists g:Goal, Targets P g) /\ (forall g:Goal, Targets P g -> RankGoal g = RankGoal g).
  Proof.
  (* Trivial equality placeholder. The important contract is that any
     selected plan maps to a goal that is scorable under value
     metrics. This is needed for plan arbitration in orchestration. *)
  Admitted.

  (* HumanPrimacyCompliance: Any Plan P that passes AlignmentRespect
     necessarily respects AnthroPraxis NonSubjugation and Consent. *)
  Theorem HumanPrimacyCompliance : forall (P:Plan),
    RespectsAnthro P -> HumanSafe P.
  Parameter HumanSafe : Plan -> Prop.
  Proof.
  Admitted.

  (* CosmologicalFeasibility: Any P that is Feasible obeys causal
     limits of CosmoPraxis and resource bounds. *)
  Theorem CosmologicalFeasibility : forall (P:Plan),
    Feasible P -> RespectsCosmo P.
  Proof.
  Admitted.
