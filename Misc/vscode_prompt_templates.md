### A. Complete Admitted Proofs
```text
# Prompt:
You are completing an unfinished Coq proof marked "Admitted" in PXL_Core.
Use only constructive tactics (no classical axioms). Ensure the lemma aligns with the Trinity-Coherence invariant:
‚àÄs, BOX(Good(s) ‚àß TrueP(s) ‚àß Coherent(s)).
Explain reasoning in comments.
```

### B. Generate Proof Templates
```text

4. Include comments summarizing proof obligations.
```

### C. Debug SerAPI Queries
```text

Show possible Coq syntax or type mismatches, and rewrite the corrected command.
Context: serve_pxl.py uses SerAPI for proof verification with fallback patterns.
```

### D. Modal Logic Frame Properties
```text
# Prompt:
Extend this ModalPraxis frame property definition with constructive proofs.
Target: Parameterized frame properties for S4/S5 modal systems.
Constraint: Must integrate with existing PXL canonical model construction.

```text
# Prompt:
Replace pattern-matching fallbacks in serve_pxl.py with robust SerAPI calls.

## ‚úÖ **Enhanced Usage Guidelines**

### IDE Integration Tips:
* **File Context**: Keep relevant `.v`, `.py`, and `.md` files open for better completions
* **Selection Scope**: Select specific functions/lemmas for targeted assistance  
* **Multi-file Reasoning**: Use chat window for cross-file architectural questions
* **Build Integration**: Run `build.ps1` before major prompt sessions to ensure context freshness

### Prompt Customization:
```text
# Template Variables:
{NAME} - Replace with actual identifier
{SPEC} - Replace with type specification  
{CONTEXT} - Add specific file/module context
{CONSTRAINT} - Add domain-specific requirements
```

### Quality Assurance:
* Always test generated Coq proofs with `coqc`
* Run `verify_pxl.sh` after formal verification changes
* Execute relevant test suites after Python modifications
* Check pre-commit hooks before committing changes

### Context Management:
```text
# Include in prompts when relevant:
Repository Structure: Four-root directory layout
Version: v0.4.2-recovery  
Architecture: Microservices + SerAPI + RabbitMQ
Security Model: Proof-gated authorization
Performance Target: P95 < 300ms, Error rate < 5%
```
