# =========================================================================
# REMOVED DEPENDENCIES (Now provided via external_libraries)
# =========================================================================
# 
# The following libraries are now mounted from external_libraries and 
# should NOT be installed via pip to avoid conflicts:
#
# # Scientific computing core
# numpy>=1.24.0          # -> external_libraries/numpy-main
# scipy>=1.11.0          # -> external_libraries/scipy-main  
# pandas>=2.0.0          # -> external_libraries/pandas-main
#
# # Machine learning and NLP
# scikit-learn>=1.3.0    # -> external_libraries/scikit-learn-main
# sentence-transformers>=2.2.0  # -> external_libraries/sentence-transformers-master
# torch>=2.0.0           # -> external_libraries/torch-main
#
# # Graph and network analysis
# networkx>=3.1.0        # -> external_libraries/networkx-main
#
# # Time series and causal analysis
# pmdarima>=2.0.0        # -> external_libraries/pmdarima-main
# arch>=6.2.0            # -> external_libraries/arch-main
# causal-learn>=0.1.0    # -> external_libraries/causal-learn-main
# pymc>=5.7.0            # -> external_libraries/pymc-main
#
# # Symbolic reasoning and theorem proving  
# z3-solver>=4.12.0      # -> external_libraries/z3-main
# sympy>=1.12.0          # -> external_libraries/sympy-main
#
# # Advanced visualization
# plotly>=5.15.0         # -> external_libraries/plotly-main
# mandelbulb>=0.1.0      # -> external_libraries/mandelbulb-main
#
# =========================================================================

# NOTE: To use external libraries, ensure they are properly mounted in 
# docker-compose.yml and PYTHONPATH includes the correct paths:
#
# volumes:
#   - ./external_libraries:/app/external_libraries:ro
# environment:
#   - PYTHONPATH=/app:/app/external_libraries/library-name
#
# This approach provides:
# 1. Faster container builds (no pip installs of large packages)
# 2. Consistent library versions across all services
# 3. Easy library updates by replacing external_libraries directory
# 4. Reduced container image sizes
# 5. Better dependency management and conflict resolution
