"""
TELOS - The Scientist

Scientific reasoning, causal inference, and outcome prediction subsystem
for the LOGOS AGI architecture.

Capabilities:
- Structural causal modeling and inference
- Outcome prediction and forecasting
- Causal retrodiction (inferring causes from effects)
- Intervention analysis and planning
- Time series analysis and forecasting
- Scientific hypothesis testing
- Counterfactual reasoning

This subsystem provides the empirical and scientific reasoning capabilities
needed for understanding cause-and-effect relationships in complex systems.
