## Natural Languages
- **Primary:** English (for user interaction and web scraping).
- **Secondary:** Goal is to be extensible to other major world languages (e.g., Spanish, Mandarin) by swapping out embedding models.

## Algorithmic Languages (Internal Representations)
- **High-Dimensional Vectors:** The native language of semantic embeddings.
- **Geometric Clusters:** The language of pattern and structure (UMAP/DBSCAN outputs).
- **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs):** The language of workflows and dependencies, used to communicate with Archon.
- **JSON:** The universal lingua franca for all inter-service communication.
