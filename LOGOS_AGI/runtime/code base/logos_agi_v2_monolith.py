"""
Unified Fractal Ontology and Navigation Core

This module combines:
 - Ontological fractal database (persistent storage, multi-dimensional indexing)
 - TrinityVector and FractalPosition data types
 - KD-tree spatial indexing for trinity and complex space
 - FractalNavigator for Mandelbrot-based mapping, stability, and theological exploration

All overlapping definitions have been merged and redundant code removed for clarity and performance.

# This is an informational file defining the scope of Tetragnos's capabilities.

## Formal Languages
- **Propositional Logic:** Understanding of basic operators (AND, OR, NOT, IMPLIES).
- **Predicate Logic:** Handling of quantifiers (∀ for all, ∃ there exists).
- **Typed Lambda Calculus:** Ability to parse and generate the structures used by Thonoc.
- **Python Abstract Syntax Trees (AST):** For self-improvement analysis.

## Natural Languages
- **Primary:** English (for user interaction and web scraping).
- **Secondary:** Goal is to be extensible to other major world languages (e.g., Spanish, Mandarin) by swapping out embedding models.

## Algorithmic Languages (Internal Representations)
- **High-Dimensional Vectors:** The native language of semantic embeddings.
- **Geometric Clusters:** The language of pattern and structure (UMAP/DBSCAN outputs).
- **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs):** The language of workflows and dependencies, used to communicate with Archon.
- **JSON:** The universal lingua franca for all inter-service communication.
