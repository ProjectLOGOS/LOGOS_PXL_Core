"""
THONOC - The Logician

Formal reasoning, proof construction, and modal logic subsystem
for the LOGOS AGI architecture.

Capabilities:
- Formal proof construction and verification
- Modal logic reasoning (necessity, possibility, knowledge, belief)
- Lambda calculus evaluation and type checking
- Axiomatic system validation
- Logical consistency checking
- Theorem proving and mathematical reasoning
- Consequence assignment and moral reasoning

This subsystem provides the foundational logical and mathematical reasoning
capabilities that underpin all higher-order AGI functions.
