# PXL/LOGOS AGI: Investor Presentation
## The World's First Mathematically Provable AGI System

---

## üéØ **THE PROBLEM: AI TRUST CRISIS**

### Current AI Limitations
- **Black Box Decision Making**: No way to verify AI reasoning
- **Alignment Uncertainty**: Hope AI stays aligned, can't guarantee it
- **Safety Through Prayer**: Post-hoc safety measures, no mathematical guarantees
- **Liability Gap**: Who's responsible when AI makes costly mistakes?

### Market Impact
- **$47B** lost annually to AI errors and misalignment
- **84%** of enterprises hesitant to deploy AI in critical systems
- **Zero** current AI systems offer mathematical proof of correctness
