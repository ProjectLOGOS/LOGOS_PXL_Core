# LOGOS_PXL_Core v0.5 Development Roadmap
**From Research Prototype to Production-Ready Verified AGI System**

---

## 🎯 **Vision Statement for v0.5**

Transform LOGOS_PXL_Core from v0.4.2-recovery (93.3% verification ratio) to v0.5 (100% verified system) suitable for production deployment with formal AGI alignment guarantees.

---

## 📊 **Current State Analysis (v0.4.2-recovery)**

### **Formal Verification Status**
- **Total Coq Files**: 179 `.v` files
- **Admitted Proofs**: 57 unfinished proofs
- **Verification Ratio**: 93.30% (Target: 100%)
- **Distribution**:
  - 🟢 **Experimental**: 34 admitted (low priority)
  - 🟡 **Infrastructure**: 40 admitted (medium priority)  
  - 🔴 **Core**: 0 admitted (already verified ✅)

### **SerAPI Integration Issues**
- **Security Risk**: Pattern-matching fallbacks bypass formal verification
- **Reliability**: Single-point-of-failure SerAPI session management
- **Performance**: No proof caching, repeated verification overhead
- **Monitoring**: Limited observability into proof verification process

### **Architecture Strengths**
- ✅ **Microservices Framework**: Well-structured, proof-gated architecture
- ✅ **Trinity Principles**: Philosophical grounding implemented

## 🚀 **v0.5 Development Phases**

### **Phase 1: Formal Verification Completion (Weeks 1-2)**

#### **Priority 1: Infrastructure Proofs (40 proofs)**
Using VS Code prompt template: *"Complete Admitted Proofs"*
```text
Target files:
- PXL_IEL_overlay_system/modules/infra/arithmo/Core/Numbers.v
- PXL_IEL_overlay_system/modules/IEL/infra/ChronoPraxis/theorems/ModalStrength/ModalRules.v
- PXL_IEL_overlay_system/modules/IEL/infra/ChronoPraxis/substrate/ChronoPraxis_PXL_Proofs.v

Strategy: Apply Trinity-Coherence invariant ∀s, BOX(Good(s) ∧ TrueP(s) ∧ Coherent(s))
```

#### **Priority 2: Experimental Module Quarantine**
- Move experimental modules with admitted proofs to `_experimental/` directories
- Update build system to exclude experimental modules from verification requirements
- Maintain quarantine status until proofs completed

#### **Success Metrics**:
- Infrastructure verification ratio: 100%
- Core verification ratio: 100% (maintained)
- Overall verification ratio: 95%+ (with experimental quarantine)

### **Phase 2: SerAPI Security Hardening (Weeks 2-3)**

#### **Eliminate Fallback Patterns**
Using VS Code prompt template: *"Fix SerAPI Integration"*
```python
Target: PXL_IEL_overlay_system/pxl-prover/serve_pxl.py lines 220-250
- Remove pattern-matching fallbacks
- Implement fail-closed security model
- Add comprehensive error handling
```

#### **Fault-Tolerant Session Management**
Using VS Code prompt template: *"Fault-Tolerant SerAPI Session"*
```python
Implement:
- Connection pooling and automatic reconnection
- Proof result caching with hash validation  
- Timeout handling and graceful degradation
- Structured logging for audit compliance
```

#### **Success Metrics**:
- Zero fallback activations in production
- P95 latency < 300ms (vs current 1,058ms)
- 99.9% SerAPI availability
- Complete audit trail for all proof requests

### **Phase 3: Production Readiness (Weeks 3-4)**

#### **Performance Optimization**
- Implement proof caching and memoization
- Add connection pooling for SerAPI processes
- Optimize Docker container startup times
- Add performance monitoring and alerting

#### **Security Hardening**
- HMAC authentication for all API endpoints
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Certificate management and TLS termination
- Vulnerability scanning and compliance

#### **Operational Excellence**
- Enhanced monitoring and observability
- Automated deployment and rollback capabilities
- Load testing and capacity planning
- Incident response procedures

#### **Success Metrics**:
- P95 latency < 300ms
- Error rate < 1%
- 99.9% availability SLO
- Zero security vulnerabilities
