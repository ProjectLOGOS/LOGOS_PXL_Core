# ChronoPraxis Glossary (Plain English)

This glossary translates the formal concepts in ChronoPraxis domains into everyday language for non-technical readers.

## Core Temporal Framework

- **χ_A (lived time)**: How an agent experiences time. Personal, step-by-step unfolding of events. This is your subjective experience of "now" → "next" → "later."

- **χ_B (physics time)**: Shared, measured time in a coordinate system. Clock time that physicists use in equations. Laboratory time, GPS time, or any standardized temporal reference.

- **χ_C (eternal time)**: Timeless view. The "finished outcome" space where all temporal perspectives converge. What remains true regardless of when or how you experience it.

## Temporal Mappings

- **A_to_B, B_to_C, A_to_C**: Exact translations between these temporal views. Like translating between languages - same meaning, different perspectives.
  - A_to_B: "How does my personal experience translate to physics time?"
  - B_to_C: "How does physics time embed in eternal truth?"
  - A_to_C: "How does my experience directly connect to timeless reality?"

## Domain-Specific Concepts

### Compatibilism (Free Will)
- **Freedom**: "There exists a real alternative in lived time that leads to the same eternal outcome." You had genuine choices in your temporal experience, even though they all converge to the same timeless result.

- **Agent**: A person or entity capable of making temporal choices. Has an identity and experiences time subjectively.

- **Alternative**: Two different ways of experiencing time (χ_A) that map to the same eternal truth (χ_C). Like taking different routes to the same destination.

### Empiricism (Physics Integration)
- **Observational coherence**: Measuring via different routes (A→C vs A→B→C) yields the same eternal content. Your personal measurement and the physics textbook measurement agree about what actually happened.

- **Observer Frame**: Your personal laboratory or measurement setup. Includes your clocks and instruments.

- **Coordinate Frame**: The standardized physics reference system. What textbooks use for calculations.

### Modal Ontology (Possible Worlds)
- **Accessibility**: Two eternal truths are related if a single lived-time witness maps to both; this collapses to equality in χ_C. Different possibilities that turn out to be the same eternal reality.

- **Modal Collapse**: All possible worlds reduce to the same eternal outcome. What seemed like different possibilities were just different ways of experiencing the same timeless truth.

- **Temporal Path**: A route from personal experience to eternal reality. Your journey through time toward timeless truth.

## How to Use This Framework

### Starting Point: Begin in χ_A
- Start with lived experience: choices, observations, personal temporal flow
- This is where agency, measurement, and possibility feel real

### Translation: Move to χ_B
- Translate to physics time to compare across frames
- This is where science happens: shared measurements, coordinate systems

### Convergence: Arrive in χ_C
- Translate to eternal time to check path-independent truth
- This is where ultimate reality resides: timeless, objective, final

### The Pattern: A→B→C or A→C
- Both routes should give the same eternal result
- If they don't, something is wrong with your temporal logic
- Coherence means all paths converge to the same cosmic truth

## Practical Examples

### Free Will Scenario
- **χ_A**: You experience choosing coffee vs tea
- **χ_C**: Both choices map to "had a warm beverage at 3pm"
- **Freedom**: The real alternative existed in your lived experience, even though the eternal outcome was the same

### Physics Measurement
- **χ_A**: You time a falling object with your stopwatch
- **χ_B**: Physics lab measures with precise instruments
- **χ_C**: Both measurements converge on the same gravitational constant
- **Coherence**: Personal and professional measurements agree about eternal physical law

### Modal Possibility
- **χ_A**: You imagine different life choices (career, relationships, location)
- **χ_C**: All imagined paths converge to the same eternal truth about who you are
- **Collapse**: What seemed like different possible worlds were just different temporal experiences of the same cosmic reality
