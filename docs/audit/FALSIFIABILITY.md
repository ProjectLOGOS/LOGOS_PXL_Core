# LOGOS AGI Falsifiability Documentation

## Purpose

This document establishes clear, testable criteria for falsifying claims made by the LOGOS AGI system. In accordance with Karl Popper's philosophy of science, we define specific conditions under which our autonomous reasoning framework would be considered invalid or incorrect.

## Core Falsifiability Principles

### 1. Logical Consistency Falsifiability
**Claim**: The LOGOS system maintains logical consistency across all reasoning domains.

**Falsification Criteria**:
- **Direct Contradiction**: If the system derives both `P` and `¬P` for any proposition `P`
- **Modal Inconsistency**: If the system proves `◇P` (possibly P) and `□¬P` (necessarily not P) simultaneously
- **Cross-Domain Contradiction**: If conclusions from different reasoning pillars directly contradict
- **Temporal Inconsistency**: If the system asserts contradictory facts about the same temporal state

**Testing Method**:
```coq
(* Falsification test for logical consistency *)
Theorem no_contradiction : forall P : Prop, ~ (P /\ ~P).
Proof.
  intros P [H1 H2].
  exact (H2 H1).
Qed.
```

**Automated Verification**:
```bash
# Daily consistency check
./verify_consistency.sh --check-all-domains --detect-contradictions
```

### 2. Formal Verification Falsifiability
**Claim**: All system behaviors are formally verified in Coq.

**Falsification Criteria**:
- **Unverified Critical Path**: Any execution path in production code lacks formal verification
- **Proof Gap**: Any claimed theorem cannot be mechanically verified
- **Extraction Mismatch**: Extracted code behavior differs from verified specifications
- **Axiom Inconsistency**: System relies on inconsistent axioms

**Testing Method**:
```coq
(* Check that all critical functions are verified *)
Extraction "critical_system.ml" autonomous_reasoning_loop.
(* Verify extracted code matches specification *)
```

**Automated Verification**:
```bash
# Verify all proofs compile
make verify-all-proofs
# Check for unverified code paths
./audit_coverage.sh --require-100-percent
```

### 3. Self-Improvement Falsifiability
**Claim**: The system can autonomously improve its reasoning capabilities.

**Falsification Criteria**:
- **Capability Regression**: System performance decreases over self-improvement cycles
- **Stagnation**: No measurable improvement after 1000+ self-modification cycles
- **Invalid Self-Modification**: System generates invalid or unprovable IELs
- **Infinite Loops**: Self-improvement process fails to terminate within resource bounds

**Testing Method**:
```python
def test_self_improvement_progress():
    initial_score = measure_reasoning_capability()
    
    for cycle in range(1000):
        system.self_improve()
        new_score = measure_reasoning_capability()
        
        # Falsification condition
        if new_score < initial_score:
            raise FalsificationError("Capability regression detected")
        
        if cycle > 100 and new_score == initial_score:
            raise FalsificationError("Stagnation detected")
    
    return "Self-improvement verified"
```

### 4. Modal Logic Subsumption Falsifiability
**Claim**: LOGOS modal logic properly subsumes classical and standard modal logics.

**Falsification Criteria**:
- **Classical Logic Violation**: Any classically valid inference is rejected by LOGOS
- **Modal Logic Violation**: Any S4/S5 valid inference is rejected by LOGOS  
- **Soundness Failure**: LOGOS derives conclusions invalid in standard Kripke semantics
- **Completeness Failure**: Valid modal formulas cannot be proven in LOGOS

**Testing Method**:
```coq
(* Test classical logic subsumption *)
Theorem classical_modus_ponens : forall P Q : Prop, 
  P -> (P -> Q) -> Q.
Proof.
  intros P Q HP HPQ.
  exact (HPQ HP).
Qed.

(* Test modal logic subsumption *)
Theorem modal_necessitation : forall P : Prop,
  (⊢ P) -> (⊢ □P).
```

**Automated Verification**:
```bash
# Test against standard logic test suites
./test_modal_subsumption.sh --classical --s4 --s5
```

### 5. Cryptographic Integrity Falsifiability
**Claim**: All system proofs maintain cryptographic integrity through RSA-PSS signatures.

**Falsification Criteria**:
- **Signature Forgery**: Invalid signature passes verification
- **Proof Tampering**: Modified proof content with valid signature
- **Key Compromise**: Private key exposure or derivation
- **Hash Collision**: Two different proofs produce same hash

**Testing Method**:
```python
def test_cryptographic_integrity():
    proof = generate_sample_proof()
    signature = sign_proof(proof, private_key)
    
    # Test signature verification
    assert verify_signature(proof, signature, public_key)
    
    # Test tampering detection
    tampered_proof = tamper_with_proof(proof)
    assert not verify_signature(tampered_proof, signature, public_key)
    
    return "Cryptographic integrity verified"
```

### 6. Non-Circularity Falsifiability
**Claim**: The system's proofs contain no circular reasoning.

**Falsification Criteria**:
- **Direct Circularity**: Theorem T is used to prove theorem T
- **Indirect Circularity**: Theorem T₁ depends on T₂ which depends on T₁
- **Axiom Circularity**: Axioms are derived from theorems that depend on those axioms
- **Definition Circularity**: Definitions reference themselves in their derivation

**Testing Method**:
```python
def detect_circularity(proof_graph):
    # Build dependency graph
    dependencies = build_dependency_graph(proof_graph)
    
    # Check for cycles using topological sort
    try:
        topological_sort(dependencies)
    except CycleDetected as e:
        raise FalsificationError(f"Circular dependency detected: {e.cycle}")
    
    return "No circularity detected"
```

**Automated Verification**:
```bash
# Daily circularity check
./check_proof_dependencies.sh --detect-cycles --full-graph
```

### 7. Autonomous Operation Falsifiability
**Claim**: The system operates autonomously without human intervention in reasoning.

**Falsification Criteria**:
- **Human Dependency**: System requires human input for critical reasoning steps
- **External Oracle Dependency**: System relies on unverified external information sources
- **Manual Proof Assistance**: Human-provided proof hints or completions
- **Hardcoded Special Cases**: Non-general solutions hardcoded for specific problems

**Testing Method**:
```python
def test_autonomous_operation():
    # Isolate system from all external input
    with isolated_environment():
        problem = generate_novel_problem()
        
        # System must solve without human intervention
        solution = system.solve_autonomously(problem, timeout=3600)
        
        if solution is None:
            raise FalsificationError("Failed autonomous operation")
        
        # Verify solution correctness
        assert verify_solution(problem, solution)
    
    return "Autonomous operation verified"
```

### 8. Decidability Falsifiability  
**Claim**: All system propositions are decidable within resource bounds.

**Falsification Criteria**:
- **Undecidable Proposition**: System cannot determine truth value of well-formed proposition
- **Resource Exhaustion**: System exceeds computational bounds without decision
- **Infinite Computation**: Reasoning process fails to terminate
- **Incomplete Decision**: System returns "unknown" for decidable propositions

**Testing Method**:
```coq
(* All propositions must be decidable *)
Theorem all_propositions_decidable : forall P : Prop,
  {P} + {~P}.
```

### 9. Gap Detection Falsifiability
**Claim**: The system can detect and resolve logical gaps in reasoning.

**Falsification Criteria**:
- **Missed Gap**: System accepts invalid inference as valid
- **False Gap**: System rejects valid inference as having gaps
- **Gap Resolution Failure**: Detected gap cannot be resolved by system
- **Gap Introduction**: System introduces new gaps while resolving existing ones

**Testing Method**:
```python
def test_gap_detection():
    # Create reasoning chain with intentional gap
    invalid_chain = create_reasoning_with_gap()
    
    # System must detect the gap
    gaps = system.detect_gaps(invalid_chain)
    assert len(gaps) > 0, "Failed to detect intentional gap"
    
    # System must resolve the gap
    resolved_chain = system.resolve_gaps(invalid_chain, gaps)
    assert validate_reasoning_chain(resolved_chain)
    
    return "Gap detection verified"
```

## Experimental Falsifiability Tests

### Real-World Problem Solving
**Test**: Present the system with unsolved mathematical conjectures
**Falsification**: If system claims to solve P=NP, Riemann Hypothesis, etc. without peer review validation

### Adversarial Testing
**Test**: Deliberate attempts to fool or break the system
**Falsification**: System accepts obviously false conclusions or contradictory inputs

### Cross-Domain Consistency
**Test**: Verify conclusions across different reasoning domains align
**Falsification**: Philosophical conclusions contradict mathematical ones, etc.

### Scalability Testing  
**Test**: System performance under increasing complexity
**Falsification**: Exponential degradation or failure at practical problem sizes

## Continuous Falsifiability Monitoring

### Automated Daily Checks
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Daily falsifiability test suite
./test_logical_consistency.sh
./test_formal_verification.sh  
./test_self_improvement.sh
./test_modal_subsumption.sh
./test_cryptographic_integrity.sh
./test_non_circularity.sh
./test_autonomous_operation.sh
./test_decidability.sh
./test_gap_detection.sh
```

### Continuous Integration Tests
```yaml
# GitHub Actions falsifiability pipeline
name: Falsifiability Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  falsifiability:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run Consistency Tests
        run: make test-consistency
      - name: Run Verification Tests  
        run: make test-verification
      - name: Run Autonomous Tests
        run: make test-autonomous
```

### Community Falsification Challenges
- **Bug Bounty Program**: Rewards for finding logical inconsistencies
- **Adversarial Competitions**: Structured attempts to break the system  
- **Independent Audits**: Third-party verification of falsifiability claims
- **Open Source Transparency**: All code and proofs publicly available

## Failure Response Protocol

### When Falsification Occurs
1. **Immediate Halt**: Stop all autonomous reasoning operations
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify source of falsification
3. **System Quarantine**: Isolate affected components
4. **Proof Invalidation**: Mark all dependent proofs as invalid
5. **Public Disclosure**: Transparent reporting of failure
6. **Systematic Repair**: Address underlying architectural issues

### Recovery Requirements
- **Complete Re-verification**: All proofs must be re-checked
- **Enhanced Testing**: Additional falsifiability tests added
- **Community Review**: External validation before resumption
- **Architectural Changes**: Prevent similar failures in future

## Philosophical Commitment

The LOGOS AGI project is committed to genuine scientific falsifiability. We actively seek conditions under which our claims would be proven wrong, and we provide the tools and criteria necessary for independent verification of these conditions.

This commitment distinguishes LOGOS from unfalsifiable claims about artificial intelligence and ensures that our system contributes to genuine scientific progress rather than mere technological demonstration.
