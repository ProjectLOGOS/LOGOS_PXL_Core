def validate_experiment_results(control_data, experimental_data):
    # Normality testing
    _, control_p = stats.shapiro(control_data)
    _, exp_p = stats.shapiro(experimental_data)
    
    # Choose appropriate test
    if control_p > 0.05 and exp_p > 0.05:
        # Parametric test
        t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(control_data, experimental_data)
    else:
        # Non-parametric test
        t_stat, p_value = stats.mannwhitneyu(control_data, experimental_data)
    
    # Effect size calculation
    effect_size = cohen_d(control_data, experimental_data)
    
    return {
        "p_value": p_value,
        "effect_size": effect_size,

```

## Safety and Monitoring

### Continuous Monitoring
All experiments include real-time safety monitoring:

```python
# Safety monitoring system
class SafetyMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.consistency_checker = ConsistencyChecker()
        self.resource_monitor = ResourceMonitor()
        self.behavior_analyzer = BehaviorAnalyzer()
    
    def monitor_experiment(self, experiment):
        while experiment.is_running():
            # Check logical consistency
            if not self.consistency_checker.verify():
                experiment.emergency_halt("Consistency violation")
            
            # Monitor resource usage
            if self.resource_monitor.exceeds_limits():
                experiment.graceful_shutdown("Resource limits")
            
            # Analyze behavioral patterns
            if self.behavior_analyzer.detects_anomaly():
                experiment.investigate("Behavioral anomaly")
```

### Emergency Protocols
Clear protocols for handling unexpected results:

1. **Immediate Halt**: Stop all autonomous operations
