(* For Box, K axiom implies mp for Box implication? Wait, valid_K is more complex.
   Perhaps forces_box_K is for general implication, not Box.
   Since φ -> ψ is not necessarily Box.
   So, perhaps assume general mp.
   But in modal logic, implication is defined via forces.
   Since forces w (φ -> ψ) is not defined, perhaps the class is for the logic properties.
   For now, assume we have mp for general implication.

(* Since forces for -> is not defined, perhaps the classes are placeholders.
