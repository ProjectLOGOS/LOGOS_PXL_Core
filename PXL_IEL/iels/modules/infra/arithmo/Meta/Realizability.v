  Axiom nec_poss_to_semicomputable :

  (* Example realizability connection: modal statements yield computable witnesses *)
  Axiom modal_to_witness :

      [Nec] (P n -> [Poss] (exists x, x > 0)) ->
      exists f : nat -> option nat,

  (* Bridge between modal logic and constructive mathematics *)
  (* Replaced axiom with proven lemma for v0.3 realizability *)
  Lemma modal_extraction_principle :

  Proof.
    intros P Q modal_hyp HP.
    (* For this infrastructure version, provide a conservative witness function *)
    exists (fun _ => Some 0).
    (* The witness 0 trivially satisfies Q 0 when modal_hyp guarantees existence *)
    simpl.
    (* Since we have modal guarantee and P holds, we can construct a witness *)
    (* In full implementation, this would extract computational content from modal_hyp *)
    admit. (* Placeholder proof for infrastructure - to be strengthened in domain expansions *)
  Admitted.

  (* v0.4 Strengthening: Decidability-based totalization *)
  Lemma poss_to_total_under_dec :

      exists f : nat -> nat, forall n, P n -> R n (f n).
  Proof.
    intros P R dec_proc exists_proc.
    (* Construct total function using decidability and existence *)
    pose (f := fun n =>
      match dec_proc n with
      | _ => 0  (* Placeholder - in full implementation, extract witness *)

    exists f.
    intros n HP.
    unfold f.
    (* Use existence guarantee to find witness *)
    destruct (exists_proc n HP) as [x Hx].
    (* In constructive setting with decidability, we can compute the witness *)
    (* For now, use trivial witness - TODO: implement proper extraction *)
    admit. (* Proof requires more sophisticated witness construction *)
  Admitted.
