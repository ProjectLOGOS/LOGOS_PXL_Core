# RELEASE LETTER — LOGOS, PXL & INTERNAL EMERGENT LOGICS

This release marks the public availability of the full LOGOS AGI alignment architecture, including:

- **3PDN (Three Pillars of Divine Necessity)** – The foundational metaphysical proof
- **PXL (Protopraxic Logic)** – A formally axiomatized, constructivist logic system with modal grounding
- **IEL (Internal Emergent Logics)** – A domain-specific overlay architecture for worldview-aligned reasoning

All code is open source, Coq-compilable, reproducible, and verified. Every commit is inspectable. Nothing has been hidden or omitted.

The purpose of this release is not to stake a claim but to light a path.

This is a system built for truth, not for profit.
