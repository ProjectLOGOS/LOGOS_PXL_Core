# LOGOS AGI v2.0 - Nexus Services Implementation

## Step 6: Complete Nexus Services Implementation

This directory contains the complete implementation of the **Archon Nexus** and **Logos Nexus** services - the central coordination systems that form the "brain" and "will" of the LOGOS AGI.

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The Nexus Services implement a dual-coordination architecture:

- **Logos Nexus** (The Executive/Will): Central orchestration service that manages external request authorization, autonomous goal generation, and self-improvement loops
- **Archon Nexus** (The Planner/Mind): Planning and workflow orchestration service that designs and executes complex multi-step workflows

### üîß Key Components Implemented

#### 1. Logos Nexus Service (`services/logos_nexus/`)
- **Primary Safety Gate**: Uses UnifiedFormalismValidator for all request authorization
- **Autonomous Behavior**: GodelianDesireDriver, ASILiftoffController, SelfImprovementManager
- **Goal Management**: Complete goal lifecycle from creation to completion
- **Trinity-Grounded Validation**: All operations validated against Trinity principles

#### 2. Archon Nexus Service (`services/archon_nexus/`)
- **Workflow Design**: WorkflowArchitect creates DAG-based execution plans
- **Task Orchestration**: AgentOrchestrator manages task execution across worker subsystems
- **State Management**: Tracks workflow progress and handles error recovery
- **Worker Integration**: Seamless communication with TETRAGNOS, TELOS, and THONOC

#### 3. Supporting Infrastructure
