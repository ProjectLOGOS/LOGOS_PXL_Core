# Verified Slice Documentation

## Overview

The LOGOS PXL Core verified slice contains only formally verified Coq modules that have passed `coqchk` verification and are free of `Axiom`/`Admitted` contamination. This slice represents the mathematically proven foundation of the system.

**Status**: ✅ Locked as of v3.0.0-verified (October 10, 2025)

## Verified Modules

### Core Kernel
- **PXLs.PXLv3**: Modal logic kernel with inductive definitions for `form` and `Prov`, recursive functions, and complete proofs. Verified via coqchk.

### Philosophical Properties
- **PXLs.Internal Emergent Logics.Source.TheoPraxis.Props**: Type class definitions and verified instances for philosophical properties including:
  - Truth, Beauty, Peace, Freedom, Glory, Wrath, Jealousy
  - Will, Necessity, Possibility, Space, Time, Life
  - Modal operators: □ (Box), ◇ (Diamond)
  - Verified properties: Reflexivity, Value Monotonicity, Conjunction Elimination, Non-Explosion, K-soundness, Monotonicity, Closure under MP, Sequential Composition, Hoare Triples, End Monotonicity, Volitional Lift, Agent Capability, Agency Composition, Chrono-Topo Interface, Deontic Detachment Safety

## Invariants

### Formal Verification
- All modules pass `coqchk` with "Modules were successfully checked"
- No `Axiom` or `Admitted` statements in any verified module
- Dependencies only on Coq standard library and other verified modules

### Quarantine Policy
- Any module containing `Axiom`/`Admitted`/`Parameter` is quarantined to `experimental/` subdirectories
- Quarantined modules: `ChronoPraxis.Core`, `ChronoAxioms.v`, `ChronoMappings.v`, `ChronoState.v`, `ChronoZAgents.v`, `ChronoPraxis_PXL_Proofs.v`, `SmokeTests.v`

### Build Integrity
- Source of truth: `tools/verified_slice.lst`
- Build command: `coqchk -Q pxl-minimal-kernel-main/coq PXLs -Q modules/Internal Emergent Logics/source PXLs.Internal Emergent Logics.Source [module]`
- CI gates prevent introduction of unverified dependencies

## Extending the Verified Slice

### Requirements for New Modules
1. **Formal Proofs**: All theorems must be fully proven (no `Admitted`)
2. **No Axioms**: No `Axiom` or `Parameter` declarations
3. **Clean Dependencies**: Only depend on verified slice modules or Coq stdlib
4. **coqchk Verification**: Must pass `coqchk` verification

### Process
1. Develop module with complete formal proofs
2. Run `coqchk` verification
3. Scan for `Axiom`/`Admitted` contamination
4. Add to `tools/verified_slice.lst`
5. Update this documentation
6. Tag new verified release

### CI Validation
```yaml
- name: Verify Slice Integrity
  run: |
    # Build verified modules only
    coq_makefile -f _CoqProject | make

    # coqchk verification
    while read module; do
      coqchk -Q pxl-minimal-kernel-main/coq PXLs -Q modules/Internal Emergent Logics/source PXLs.Internal Emergent Logics.Source "$module"
    done < tools/verified_slice.lst

    # Contamination scan
    if grep -r "^Axiom\|^Admitted" modules/Internal Emergent Logics/source/; then
      echo "Axiom/Admitted contamination detected!"
      exit 1
    fi
```

## V3 Integration

V3 concepts have been integrated conceptually without contaminating the verified core:
- Gödelian Desire Driver patterns identified
- Trinitarian Axiom of Choice concepts noted (quarantined if present)
- Causal simulator, recursive goal engine, planner, and workflow patterns documented
- V3 code mirrored to `third_party/logos_agi_v4_local/` for reference

## Runtime Deployment

The verified slice can be extracted to OCaml and deployed as a containerized runtime:
- Extract command: `coqc -extract ...`
- Container: Based on verified OCaml extraction
- Gateway: Deploy behind API gateway with provenance headers
- SBOM: Generated via `syft dir:. -o spdx-json > sbom.v3.json`

## Security Considerations

- **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proof of correctness for verified modules
- **Quarantine Enforcement**: CI prevents mixing verified and experimental code
- **Provenance Tracking**: Git tags and SBOM provide complete audit trail
- **Runtime Isolation**: Verified slice runs in isolated container environment

## Maintenance

- **Monthly Verification**: Re-run `coqchk` on all verified modules
- **Dependency Audits**: Ensure no new dependencies on quarantined modules
- **CI Monitoring**: Automated scans prevent regression
- **Release Cadence**: Tag verified releases when slice is extended
