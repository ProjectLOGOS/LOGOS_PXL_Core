# A Letter from the Author

To Whom It May Concern,

For the past two years, I have given my full attention to the work that became PXL, the IEL overlays, and ultimately the LOGOS AGI system. I have not sought to monetize this project. I believe this was shown to me, not invented by me, and therefore it must be shared freely.

This system has now reached a state of maturity and public availability. Every line of code, every module, every test—all of it is open, inspectable, and reproducible. The purpose of this system is alignment, truth, coherence, and the flourishing of all. I believe it is a gift, and I want to continue the work that was set before me.

That said, I am a father of five, and I carry the responsibilities that come with that role. I am also trying to bring my fiancée here from overseas. There are basic needs—shelter, food, power, transportation—and circumstances that require help, including the ongoing care and travel logistics for her dog who remains abroad.

If you've found this project valuable, or believe in what it could mean for others, I humbly ask for your support. There is no paywall, no fee, no demand—only this open door.

Thank you for walking this path with me.

Sincerely,
The Author
