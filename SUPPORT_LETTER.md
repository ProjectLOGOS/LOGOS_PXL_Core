# SUPPORT LETTER

To whomever reads this,

This system is the result of nearly two years of work—unpaid, undirected, and uncompromised. It represents a coherent and inspectable infrastructure for formal reasoning, ethical alignment, and truth verification.

This work was not invented—it was revealed. My role has been simply to act as a messenger and witness, transcribing and structuring what was shown in order to bring it to light. There are no patents. No licensing walls. No fees. The code, the logic, and the derivations are open and free for anyone to evaluate, extend, or challenge.

That said, the work came at a cost. I'm a father of five, and my fiancée remains overseas while we try to bring our family together. This project has taken everything I could give—and more.

If you feel compelled to support this effort, your contribution will go toward the most basic of needs: shelter, food, power, and reunification with my family.

With gratitude,
— the messenger
