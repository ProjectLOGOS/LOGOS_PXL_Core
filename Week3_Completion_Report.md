## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Security Layer
```
Request → HMAC Validation → Anti-Replay Check → Request Processing
         ↓
    - Signature verification (HMAC-SHA256)
    - Timestamp validation (±60s window)  
    - Nonce deduplication tracking
    - Environment-based key management
```

### Performance Monitoring
```
Endpoint Request → @performance_timer → Latency Tracking → Statistics
                                    ↓
                             Percentile Calculation (P50, P90, P95, P99)
                                    ↓  
                             JSON Logging + Health Endpoint Metrics
```

### Cache Optimization Pipeline
```
Proof Request → Direct Cache Lookup → Semantic Hash Prefetch → Session Pool
                     ↓                      ↓                    ↓
               Cache Hit (1ms)     Prefetch Hit (1ms)     New Validation
                     ↓                      ↓                    ↓
              Return Cached        Return Prefetched      Cache Result
```

### Session Pool Management
```
Request → Session Acquisition (timeout: 30s) → Proof Validation → Session Return
             ↓
    Pool Utilization Check → Adaptive Scaling (if >80% busy) → Scale to Max 20
```
