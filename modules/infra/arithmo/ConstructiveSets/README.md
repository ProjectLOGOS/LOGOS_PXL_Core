## Dependencies
- `IEL.ArithmoPraxis.Core.Numbers` - Natural number foundations
- `IEL.ArithmoPraxis.BooleanLogic.Decidability` - Decidable predicates
- Coq standard library `Lists`, `Logic`, `Relations`

## Integration Points
- **BooleanLogic**: Set-theoretic Boolean algebras
- **CategoryTheory**: Sets as category objects
- **Topology**: Topological spaces on constructive sets
- **TypeTheory**: Sets vs. types correspondence

## Performance Goals
- Finite set operations: Handle sets with 10,000+ elements
- Membership testing: O(log n) for ordered representations
- Set construction: Efficient list-based implementations
- Quotient operations: Polynomial time in equivalence class size

## Constructive Principles
- **No Axiom of Choice**: All constructions are explicit
- **Decidable Membership**: All set predicates are decidable
- **Finite Representations**: Sets have constructive finite descriptions
- **Computational Content**: All proofs yield algorithms

## Related Domains
- **BooleanLogic**: Boolean algebras as set structures
- **CategoryTheory**: Category of constructive sets
- **NumberTheory**: Sets of numbers, prime sets
- **Topology**: Topological spaces and continuous maps

## Applications in LOGOS
- **Knowledge Representation**: Constructive knowledge sets
- **Planning**: State spaces as finite sets
- **Verification**: Set-based model checking
- **Modal Logic**: Kripke models with constructive worlds
