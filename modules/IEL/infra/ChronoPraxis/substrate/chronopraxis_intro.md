# ChronoPraxis Module — Triune Temporal Logic

**ChronoPraxis** is a triune temporal logic derived from PXL that integrates A-theory (tensed), B-theory (tenseless), and C-theory (timeless) into a domain-relative temporal calculus.

## Temporal Ontological Integration

- **A-theory → Temporal**: Agent-relative time perception (tensed, becoming)
- **B-theory → Atemporal**: Logical sequence across states (tenseless, being-in-time)  
- **C-theory → Eternal**: Metaphysical constancy (timeless, pure being)

This formal logic does not collapse these into contradiction but binds them to ontological domains of:

- **Contingent Agency** (Temporal): Agent experience, epistemic states, intentional action
- **Logical Instantiation** (Atemporal): Structural relationships, causal sequences, logical transitions
- **Necessary Being** (Eternal): Metaphysical truths, PXL axioms, ontological foundations

## Core Innovation

ChronoPraxis proves that all three time theories are **logical instantiations of triune necessity**, derived constructively through PXL. It uses **ChronoFrames** to bind propositions to time modes and defines **bijective mappings** between time-bound logic and eternal PXL propositions.

## Formal Structure

- **ChronoFrame**: `{mode: TimeMode, state: ChronoState, context: AgentContext}`
- **Triune Convergence**: All temporal modes resolve to identical eternal propositions
- **Bijective Mappings**: `chrono_to_pxl` and `pxl_to_chrono` preserve logical structure
- **Agent Integration**: Time-aware reasoning with belief/intention frame management

**Verification**: Implemented and proof-checked in Coq using constructive derivation from PXL's axiomatic foundation.
