# Internally Emergent Logics (IEL) - ChronoPraxis Tree

## Overview

The ChronoPraxis framework has been restructured under an **Internally Emergent Logics (IEL)** organizational system. This system recognizes that complex temporal reasoning emerges from the interaction of foundational substrates, tactical operations, core theorems, and interface abstractions.

## IEL Principle

**Internally Emergent Logics** posits that sophisticated reasoning systems emerge from well-structured interactions between:

1. **Substrate**: Foundational axioms and primitive constructs
2. **Tactics**: Operational procedures for manipulation and proof
3. **Theorems**: Proven mathematical results and their constructive evidence
4. **Interfaces**: Abstraction layers that expose functionality
5. **Domains**: Specialized applications to specific problem areas

## Key IEL Features

### Meta-Theorem Registry (`MetaTheorems.v`)
- `temporal_unification_meta`: Constructive bijections enable unified reasoning
- `constructive_temporal_completeness`: All temporal relations are decidable
- `IEL_meta_registry`: Aggregated emergent theorems for higher-order reasoning

### Constructive Foundations
All ChronoPraxis theorems maintain constructive proof foundations:
- `temporal_convergence`: Constructive proof of mode convergence
- `chronological_collapse_*`: Bijective collapse theorems
- `causal_bijection_*`: Causal relationship preservation
- `temporal_consistency`: Internal consistency validation

### Bijective Core
Three fundamental bijections form the temporal reasoning substrate:
- `map_AB`: Mode A ↔ Mode B constructive mapping
- `map_BC`: Mode B ↔ Mode C constructive mapping  
- `map_AC`: Mode A ↔ Mode C direct constructive mapping

## Build System

```bash
# Generate Coq makefile
make Makefile.coq

# Build all modules
make -f Makefile.coq

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

## Integration Points

- **VS Code**: Configured with `.vscode/tasks.json` for integrated builds
- **CI/CD**: Hooks available for automated verification
- **Testing**: Comprehensive smoke tests validate substrate integrity

## Domain Extensions

The `domains/` directory provides specialized temporal logic applications:
- **Compatibilism**: Reconciling free will with temporal determinism
- **Empiricism**: Experience-based temporal reasoning patterns
- **ModalOntology**: Modal temporal logics and possible world semantics

## IEL Tags

All IEL modules include standardized tags for emergent logic identification:
```coq
(* ===== IEL TAG: [CATEGORY] ===== *)
```

Categories: `SUBSTRATE`, `TACTICS`, `THEOREMS`, `META-THEOREMS`, `INTERFACES`, `DOMAINS`

## Module Status

- ChronoPraxis status: **Stable (v1.0)** — constructive, zero admits
